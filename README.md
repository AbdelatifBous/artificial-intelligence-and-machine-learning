# Artificial Intelligence from Scratch
This is a repository of artificial intelligence algorithm that were coded from scratch in different languages including Java, Python and C++. The algorithm range from classical artificial intelligence search algorithm to machine learning and deep learning algorithm. If you would like to have a certain algorithm coded and explained you are welcome to open up an [issue](https://github.com/yacineMahdid/artificial-intelligence-from-scratch/issues).
