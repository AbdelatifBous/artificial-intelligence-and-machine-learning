# EEG Headset Converter with KNN
In this notebook we will define and build a solution to convert one headset with its own label nomenclature into another headset. This is a useful transformation to be able to use to normalize heterogeneous brain data.

## Headset
The two headset we will be using to test and assess our solution will be the Brain Product headset with 66 channels and the EGI (Philips health) headset with 129 channels. Below we will look at bird eye view of each of the headset.
