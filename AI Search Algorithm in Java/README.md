# Artificial Intelligence Search Algorithm in Java â˜•
In this project we will look at different type of artificial intelligence search strategy to solve a toy puzzle game. This include uninformed search strategy (i.e. which are not using any heuristic function) like breadth first search (BFS), depth first search (DFS) or iterative deepening search (IDS) and informed search strategy like greedy search (GDS), steepest ascent hill-climbing (HCS) and A* search algorithm.

## Puzzle to Solve: Three Digits Puzzle
The toy game we will be using in this mini-project is the three digits puzzle. It is defined as follow:
Given two 3-digit numbers called _S (start)_ and _G (goal)_ and also a set of 3-digit numbers called
forbidden. We want to get from S to G in the smallest number of moves. A move is a transformation of one number into another number by adding or subtracting 1 to one of its digits. For example, a move can take you from 123 to 124 by adding 1 to the last digit or from 953 to 853 by subtracting 1 from the first digit. 

Moves must satisfy the following constraints:
1. You cannot add to the digit 9 or subtract from the digit 0;
2. You cannot make a move that transforms the current number into one of the forbidden numbers;
3. You cannot change the same digit twice in two successive moves

This puzzle was taken from the course Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - COMP3308 **[1]** from the [Univeristy of Sidney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/)

To solve this puzzle we make use of states graph and search trees. 

States graph are a mathematical representation of the world the agent is in. The nodes in the graph are properties of the world the agent care about bundled inside a state construct. In that graph each state can only occurs once and the link from one state to the other is achieved by the agent making an action from one state to another.
See below an example of a state graph for a small game of pacman:

Search trees are similar in the sense that the nodes are state, but they are different in the sense that they codify the plan to go from one node to a goal node. The tree is constructed as the agent interact with the world to fullfill its purpose and different algorithm will make use of this search tree differently.
See below an example of a search tree for a small game of pacman:

## Uninformed Search Algorithms
Uninformed search algorithm are simple algorithm that build and parse a search tree to go from one start node to a goal node. They are called uninformed because they do not make use of an heuristic function that tells them how well the move they are taking is. They blindly follow their algorithm until they hit the goal node, get stuck (for some) or run out of time.

### Breadth First Search (BFS)
![BFS](https://github.com/yacineMahdid/artificial-intelligence-from-scratch/blob/master/AI%20Search%20Algorithm%20in%20Java/.figures/bfs.png)

The strategy for bread first search is simple; it consist of looking at all the children of a given node before moving to the next node to investigate. What this will do is that the search will be conducted in stratum (as depicted in the figure above) which will be good if the goal node is not too deep in the search tree, but a big problem if the goal node is very deep.

### Depth First Search (DFS)
![DFS](https://github.com/yacineMahdid/artificial-intelligence-from-scratch/blob/master/AI%20Search%20Algorithm%20in%20Java/.figures/dfs.png)

The depth first search strategy is the complete opposite of the depth first search; it consist in going as deep as possible in the parentage tree of the start node. For instance if the first node as 10 children, the first child will be checked first, but the next node to be investigated is the grandchild of the starting node. This means that it will take quite a while before all the children of the start node are checked. This is great if the goal node is very deep, however if it's the 10th children of the start node BFS will find it way before DFS can.

### Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
![IDS](https://github.com/yacineMahdid/artificial-intelligence-from-scratch/blob/master/AI%20Search%20Algorithm%20in%20Java/.figures/ids.png)

Iterative Deepening Search is a curious algorithm as it simply run DFS multiple time, but it limit it search to a stratum depth. For instance, as depicted in the figure, it will run DFS with a max level of 1. If the goal node is found it is directly returned, however if it is not found the algorithm will reiterate with a max level of 2. This seems a bit wasteful, but because the search tree is getting wider and wider as the depth increase running the same search many time is not so problematic.

## Informed Search Algorithms
Informed search algorithm are a family of algorithm that builds upon the uninformed ones. The difference between the two is that this family makes use of various way of defining how good a move will be. They can make use of heuristic functions tailored for a specific task that will tell them how well a move is compared to another one. They can also have costs associated to making a move which can be used differently by different algorithm.

All images in this section are taken from this deck of slides **[4]** from CS188 at UC Berkeley and the Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing was taken from this website **[5]**.

### Greedy Search (GDS)
![Greedy](https://github.com/yacineMahdid/artificial-intelligence-from-scratch/blob/master/AI%20Search%20Algorithm%20in%20Java/.figures/greedy.png)

Greedy search use the heuristic function that is setup for a given environment and always pick the next best state in the possible states attainable (called the fringe). If the heuristic is very good it means that it will find the goal state very fast, however if the heurstic is approximative it might get stuck at a local optima.

### Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing (HCS)
![Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing](https://github.com/yacineMahdid/artificial-intelligence-from-scratch/blob/master/AI%20Search%20Algorithm%20in%20Java/.figures/steepest.png)

This algorithm is similar to greedy search except that it will always find the next best node in the immediate children state. This means that the algorithm will move faster down the heurstici optimization, but often do get stuck in local optima.

### A* Search
![A* Search](https://github.com/yacineMahdid/artificial-intelligence-from-scratch/blob/master/AI%20Search%20Algorithm%20in%20Java/.figures/a_start.png)

A* is a search algorithm that uses the power of greedy search, but also incorporate another cost which is the accumulated cost of moving through the search tree. It is usually the best algorithm to pick for a search in all the one we've seen so far.

## Code Structure
The code is structured in two main class:
- State class: It's purpose is to modelize how a state work and how to get the children state from the current state
- Solver class: Which uses states and implementation of the above mentioned algorithm to find a solution for the three digit puzzle problem.

The solution is divided into two section. The first is the path from the start state to the goal state. The second section is each of the state that were visited by the algorithm even if they do not belong to the solution path. This last section allows us to gain more insight about how these algorithm really works.
